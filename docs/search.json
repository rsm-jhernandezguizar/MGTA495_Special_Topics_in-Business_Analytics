    "text": "Dean Karlan at Yale and John List at the University of Chicago conducted a field experiment to test the effectiveness of different fundraising letters. They sent out 50,000 fundraising letters to potential donors, randomly assigning each letter to one of three treatments: a standard letter, a matching grant letter, or a challenge grant letter. They published the results of this experiment in the American Economic Review in 2007. The article and supporting data are available from the AEA website and from Innovations for Poverty Action as part of Harvard’s Dataverse.\nIn their study, Karlan and List discovered that announcing a matching grant significantly boosted both the probability and size of contributions, confirming that even simple price incentives can nudge donors into action. Intriguingly, however, larger match ratios (such as a $3:$1 match) did not outperform smaller ones (like $1:$1), suggesting that bigger “discounts” on giving may not always translate to bigger impacts. They also found the local political environment influenced donor responsiveness: individuals in conservative “red” states were more swayed by the matching offer than those in liberal “blue” states.

For at least one variable, perform the test as both t-test (use the formula in the class slides) and separately as a linear regression (regress for example mrm2 on treatment); confirm both methods yield the exact same results. It might be helpful to compare parts of your analysis to Table 1 in the paper. Be sure to comment on your results (hint: why is Table 1 included in the paper)."

    "text": "Experimental Results\n\nCharitable Contribution Made\nFirst, I analyze whether matched donations lead to an increased response rate of making a donation.\ntodo: make a barplot with two bars. Each bar is the proportion of people who donated. One bar for treatment and one bar for control.\ntodo: run a t-test between the treatment and control groups on the binary outcome of whether any charitable donation was made (you can do this as a bivariate linear regression if you want). It may help to confirm your calculations match Table 2a Panel A. Report your statistical results and interpret them in the context of the experiment (e.g., if you found a difference with a small p-value or something that was statistically significant at some threshold, what have you learned about human behavior? Use mostly English words, not numbers or stats, to explain your finding.)\ntodo: run a probit regression where the outcome variable is whether any charitable donation was made and the explanatory variable is assignment to treatment or control.\nNOTE: Linear regression results appear replicate Table 3 column 1 in the paper. Probit results do not, despite Table 3 indicating its results come from probit regressions…\n\n\nDifferences between Match Rates\nNext, I assess the effectiveness of different sizes of matched donations on the response rate.\ntodo: Use a series of t-tests to test whether the size of the match ratio has an effect on whether people donate or not. For example, does the 2:1 match rate lead increase the likelihood that someone donates as compared to the 1:1 match rate? Do your results support the “figures suggest” comment the authors make on page 8?\ntodo: Assess the same issue using a regression. Specifically, create the variable ratio1 then regress gave on ratio1, ratio2, and ratio3 (or alternatively, regress gave on the categorical variable ratio). Interpret the coefficients and their statistical precision.\ntodo: Calculate the response rate difference between the 1:1 and 2:1 match ratios and the 2:1 and 3:1 ratios. Do this directly from the data, and do it by computing the differences in the fitted coefficients of the previous regression. what do you conclude regarding the effectiveness of different sizes of matched donations?\n\n\nSize of Charitable Contribution\nIn this subsection, I analyze the effect of the size of matched donation on the size of the charitable contribution.\ntodo: Calculate a t-test or run a bivariate linear regression of the donation amount on the treatment status. What do we learn from doing this analysis?\ntodo: now limit the data to just people who made a donation and repeat the previous analysis. This regression allows you to analyze how much respondents donate conditional on donating some positive amount. Interpret the regression coefficients – what did we learn? Does the treatment coefficient have a causal interpretation?\ntodo: Make two plots: one for the treatment group and one for the control. Each plot should be a histogram of the donation amounts only among people who donated. Add a red vertical bar or some other annotation to indicate the sample average for each plot."

You’ll then calculate a vector of 10,000 differences, and then you’ll plot the cumulative average of that vector of differences. This average will likely be “noisey” when only averaging a few numbers, but should “settle down” and approximate the treatment effect (0.004 = 0.022 - 0.018) as the sample size gets large. Explain the chart to the reader.\n\n\nCentral Limit Theorem\nto do: Make 4 histograms at sample sizes 50, 200, 500, and 1000. To do this for a sample size of e.g. 50, take 50 draws from each of the control and treatment distributions, and calculate the average difference between those draws. Then repeat that process 999 more times so that you have 1000 averages. Plot the histogram of those averages. The repeat for the other 3 histograms. Explain this sequence of histograms and its relationship to the central limit theorem to the reader."
