The results showed that the treatment group had a mean of 13.012 months, while the control group had a mean of 12.998 months. The calculated t-statistic was 0.120 with an associated p-value of 0.9049. Since the p-value is well above the 0.05 threshold, we fail to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is no statistically significant difference between the groups. This result supports the validity of the randomization mechanism, as it suggests that both groups were balanced on this pre-treatment variable.\n\n\nHand-Composed Two-Sample t-Test for mrm2\n=========================================\nTreatment Mean (mrm2): 13.012, n=33395\nControl Mean (mrm2):   12.998, n=16687\nt-statistic:           0.120\nDegrees of freedom:    33394.48\np-value (two-sided):   0.9049\n\n\nTo validate these results using a different method, I also ran a simple linear regression where mrm2 was regressed on the treatment variable. This approach tests the same hypothesis as the t-test—that the average months since last donation is equal across groups. The estimated treatment effect (0.014) is nearly identical to the difference in group means, and the associated p-value (0.905) confirms the same conclusion: there is no statistically significant difference between the groups. This reinforces the finding that the randomization successfully created balanced groups.\n\n\nLinear regression (OLS)\nData                 : karlan_list_2007_pretty\nResponse variable    : mrm2\nExplanatory variables: treatment\nNull hyp.: the effect of x on mrm2 is zero\nAlt. hyp.: the effect of x on mrm2 is not zero\n\n           coefficient  std.error  t.value p.value     \nIntercept       12.998      0.094  138.979  &lt; .001  ***\ntreatment        0.014      0.115    0.119   0.905     \n\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n\nR-squared: 0.0, Adjusted R-squared: -0.0\nF-statistic: 0.014 df(1, 50080), p.value 0.905\nNr obs: 50,082\n\n\nAs part of the balance test, I conducted a hand-computed two-sample t-test to determine whether the treatment and control groups differed significantly on the variable freq (number of prior donations). This represents the second variable tested for robustness, following the initial test on mrm2 (months since last donation). The results showed that the treatment group had a mean of 8.035 donations, while the control group had a mean of 8.047 donations. The calculated t-statistic was -0.111 with an associated p-value of 0.9117. Since the p-value is well above the 0.05 threshold, we fail to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is no statistically significant difference between the groups. The fact that both mrm2 and freq are balanced across treatment and control groups further validates the randomization mechanism, confirming that the two groups are comparable on key pre-treatment characteristics.\n\n\nHand-Composed Two-Sample t-Test for freq\n=========================================\nTreatment Mean (freq): 8.035, n=33396\nControl Mean (freq):   8.047, n=16687\nt-statistic:           -0.111\nDegrees of freedom:    33326.35\np-value (two-sided):   0.9117\n\n\nTo validate the results from the t-test, I also performed a linear regression of freq on the treatment variable. Like the t-test, this regression assesses whether there is a statistically significant difference in the number of prior donations between treatment and control groups. The coefficient on treatment (-0.012) closely matches the difference in group means, and the p-value (0.912) confirms the same conclusion: no significant difference exists. This consistency between the regression and the hand-calculated t-test reinforces the finding that the treatment assignment did not systematically influence pre-treatment donation frequency.\n\n\nLinear regression (OLS)\nData                 : karlan_list_2007_pretty\nResponse variable    : freq\nExplanatory variables: treatment\nNull hyp.: the effect of x on freq is zero\nAlt. hyp.: the effect of x on freq is not zero\n\n           coefficient  std.error  t.value p.value     \nIntercept        8.047      0.088   91.231  &lt; .001  ***\ntreatment       -0.012      0.108   -0.111   0.912     \n\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n\nR-squared: 0.0, Adjusted R-squared: -0.0\nF-statistic: 0.012 df(1, 50081), p.value 0.912\nNr obs: 50,083\n\n\nThese results conclude the Balance Test section and provide strong support for the success of the randomization mechanism."

    "section": "Experimental Results",
    "text": "Experimental Results\n\nCharitable Contribution Made\nFirst, I analyze whether matched donations lead to an increased response rate of making a donation.\nHere’s a short paragraph you can use to replace the todo sentence in the screenshot:\nThe bar plot below shows the proportion of individuals who made a donation in the treatment and control groups. This visualization offers an early look at the potential impact of being assigned to the treatment group, with a slightly higher donation rate observed. While this plot conveys similar information to the one presented in the Data section, it is revisited here in the context of hypothesis testing to begin assessing whether the observed difference is statistically significant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on the code used in our earlier balance checks, I ran a t‐test comparing the proportion who donated (gave == 1) across the treatment and control groups. The results show that the treatment group’s average donation rate is modestly but meaningfully higher than the control group’s rate, closely mirroring the figures in Karlan and List’s Table 2a Panel A. The p‐value from this test is well below the usual 5 percent threshold, indicating that the difference is unlikely to be by chance. In real terms, such a small bump in donation rates can significantly boost total contributions, demonstrating that even a simple intervention like a matching grant can alter donor behavior. This supports the broader conclusion that small “price” or matching signals can nudge people to act, thereby increasing charitable giving.\nHere’s a clear paragraph you can use to summarize the probit regression results in context with Table 3, Column 1 from the Karlan and List (2007) paper:\nI ran a probit regression to estimate whether being assigned to the treatment group significantly increased the likelihood of making a charitable donation. The model used gave as the binary outcome and treatment as the explanatory variable. The results show a positive and statistically significant coefficient of 0.0868 (p = 0.002), indicating that assignment to the treatment group is associated with a higher probability of donating. However, this estimate does not match the coefficient reported in Table 3, Column 1 of the original paper, which shows a much smaller effect size of 0.004 with a standard error of 0.001. Despite the model setup appearing consistent, the difference in results suggests there may be differences in the underlying implementation or sample filtering. Still, the significance of the treatment variable aligns with the paper’s broader conclusion: matching grants, even modest ones, can meaningfully shift donation behavior.\n\n\nOptimization terminated successfully.\n         Current function value: 0.100443\n         Iterations 7\n\n\n\nProbit Regression Results\n\n\nDep.

For example, does the 2:1 match rate lead increase the likelihood that someone donates as compared to the 1:1 match rate? Do your results support the “figures suggest” comment the authors make on page 8?\n\n\n\n=== Checking ratio 2:1 vs. ratio 1:1 ===\nObservations in 2:1: 11134\nObservations in 1:1: 11133\nMean(gave) for 2:1: 0.0226\nMean(gave) for 1:1: 0.0207\nT-statistic: 0.9650  |  P-value: 0.3345\n\n=== Checking ratio 3:1 vs. ratio 1:1 ===\nObservations in 3:1: 11129\nObservations in 1:1: 11133\nMean(gave) for 3:1: 0.0227\nMean(gave) for 1:1: 0.0207\nT-statistic: 1.0150  |  P-value: 0.3101\n\n=== Checking ratio 2:1 vs. ratio 3:1 ===\nObservations in 2:1: 11134\nObservations in 3:1: 11129\nMean(gave) for 2:1: 0.0226\nMean(gave) for 3:1: 0.0227\nT-statistic: -0.0501  |  P-value: 0.96\n\n\ntodo: Assess the same issue using a regression. Specifically, create the variable ratio1 then regress gave on ratio1, ratio2, and ratio3 (or alternatively, regress gave on the categorical variable ratio). Interpret the coefficients and their statistical precision.\ntodo: Calculate the response rate difference between the 1:1 and 2:1 match ratios and the 2:1 and 3:1 ratios. Do this directly from the data, and do it by computing the differences in the fitted coefficients of the previous regression. what do you conclude regarding the effectiveness of different sizes of matched donations?\n\n\nSize of Charitable Contribution\nIn this subsection, I analyze the effect of the size of matched donation on the size of the charitable contribution.\ntodo: Calculate a t-test or run a bivariate linear regression of the donation amount on the treatment status. What do we learn from doing this analysis?\ntodo: now limit the data to just people who made a donation and repeat the previous analysis. This regression allows you to analyze how much respondents donate conditional on donating some positive amount. Interpret the regression coefficients – what did we learn? Does the treatment coefficient have a causal interpretation?\ntodo: Make two plots: one for the treatment group and one for the control. Each plot should be a histogram of the donation amounts only among people who donated. Add a red vertical bar or some other annotation to indicate the sample average for each plot."
